## Lesson 3: Workflow Re-engineering: Designing for Usability

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. After analyzing the current state, we can begin the process of workflow re-engineering. This is not about small tweaks; it is about fundamentally rethinking the process to make it safer and more user-centered."

**(Transition Slide: Workflow Re-engineering)**

**Narrator:** "In the context of a clinical pathway, this might involve simplifying the process by eliminating unnecessary steps, or seamlessly integrating the pathway into the EHR with features like pre-populated order sets.

"The goal is to make the pathway feel like a natural part of the clinician's job, not an extra task. This involves designing a clean and intuitive visual layout and even considering how the physical layout of the clinical space impacts the workflow."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "This deep focus on usability is what separates a pathway that looks good on paper from one that actually works in practice. By deliberately re-engineering the workflow with the user in mind, we can create pathways that reduce burnout, improve safety, and advance health equity.

"In our final module, we will discuss operational execution and impact. Thank you."
