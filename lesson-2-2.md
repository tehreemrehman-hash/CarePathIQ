## Lesson 2: The AHRQ Approach to Grading Evidence

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we explored the GRADE framework for appraising evidence. Today, we'll discuss another influential approach developed by the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, through its Evidence-based Practice Centers.

"While GRADE is often used to develop recommendations, the AHRQ approach focuses specifically on grading the overall 'strength of evidence' for a body of literature on a particular topic, such as a comparative effectiveness review."

**(Transition Slide: AHRQ Domains)**

**Narrator:** "The AHRQ's approach is conceptually very similar to GRADE and is based on a careful assessment of four key domains:
*   First, **Risk of Bias:** This looks at the degree to which the included studies are free from methodological flaws that could skew the results.
*   Second, **Consistency:** This assesses the similarity of findings across different studies. Do they all point to the same conclusion?
*   Third, **Directness:** This examines how directly the evidence answers the specific clinical question at hand. For example, does a study on a surrogate endpoint directly inform a decision about a patient-centered outcome?
*   And fourth, **Precision:** This evaluates the degree of certainty around the estimate of the effect.

"Based on a holistic assessment of these four domains, the AHRQ assigns a 'strength of evidence' grade."

**(Transition Slide: AHRQ Grades)**

**Narrator:** "These grades are:
*   **High:** This indicates high confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect.
*   **Moderate:** This indicates moderate confidence. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate itself.
*   **Low:** This indicates low confidence. Further research is likely to change the estimate.
*   And **Insufficient:** This means that evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.

"While the terminology is slightly different, you can see the clear parallels with the GRADE framework. Both systems provide a structured, transparent way to think critically about the quality of scientific evidence."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "So why is this important for our work in building clinical pathways? Because it ensures that the foundation of our pathways—the evidence itself—is solid. By using rigorous frameworks like GRADE and the AHRQ approach, we can be confident that our pathways are recommending care that is based on the best and most reliable scientific knowledge available. This is the essence of evidence-based practice.

"This concludes our module on Rapid Evidence Appraisal. In our next module, we will explore the fascinating intersection of Decision Science and Transparent AI. Thank you."
