## Lesson 3: AI in Evidence-Based Medicine

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. We've just reviewed the GRADE and AHRQ frameworks, which are essential for manually appraising evidence. But what if we could accelerate this process? The sheer volume of new research published daily makes it nearly impossible for clinicians and researchers to keep up. This is where AI comes in.

"This lesson will explore how Artificial Intelligence, particularly Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models, can help solve this evidence bottleneck."

**(Transition Slide: Manual vs. AI-powered review)**

**Narrator:** "Traditionally, a systematic review is a painstaking, manual process. It involves searching databases, screening thousands of articles, extracting data, and synthesizing the findings—a process that can take months or even years.

"AI can dramatically speed this up. NLP models can be trained to read and understand scientific text, helping to screen articles and extract key data points with incredible speed and accuracy. This doesn't eliminate the need for human experts, but it frees them from tedious manual work to focus on higher-level critical thinking and interpretation."

**Narrator:** "The impact of this is profound. It allows for the creation of 'living' clinical pathways that can be continuously updated against the latest evidence. This is a powerful example of AI transforming unstructured data—in this case, thousands of peer-reviewed articles—into structured, actionable guidance that can be embedded directly into our clinical pathways.

"In our next lesson, we will see how this AI-driven evidence can be used to power more intelligent Clinical Decision Support systems. Thank you."
