# Module 4: Human Factors Engineering

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Human Factors Engineering

**(Video Narration: 6-8 minutes)**

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome to Module 4. So far, we have discussed the importance of evidence-based medicine and decision science in the design of clinical pathways. But even the most evidence-based, unbiased pathway will fail if it is difficult or confusing for clinicians to use.

"This module is dedicated to 'Human Factors Engineering,' the science of designing for humans. In this first lesson, we will explore the core principles of this discipline and its critical importance in healthcare."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "Human Factors Engineering, or HFE, is about understanding how people interact with technology and their environment, and then using that understanding to design systems that are safe, efficient, and easy to use. In healthcare, this means designing systems that fit the way clinicians work, rather than forcing clinicians to adapt to the technology.

"The central goal of HFE in medicine is to enhance patient safety by reducing the likelihood of human error. It's about making it easy to do the right thing, and hard to do the wrong thing. Key principles include:
*   **User-Centered Design:** This means involving end-users—our clinicians and patients—in every step of the design process.
*   **Simplicity and Clarity:** Pathways should be presented in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand, even for a clinician who is tired at the end of a long shift.
*   **Standardization:** Using consistent layouts, terminology, and workflows to reduce cognitive load.
*   And **Forcing Functions:** These are design features that make it impossible to make a critical error, like a USB plug that can only be inserted one way."

**Narrator:** "A key focus of HFE is reducing cognitive load. Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort required to complete a task. In the complex, information-rich environment of healthcare, clinicians are often under immense cognitive load, which can lead to burnout and medical errors.

"Clinical pathways should be designed to *reduce*, not increase, this load. This means presenting information in a clear, concise, and visually organized way. It means minimizing clicks and unnecessary alerts in the EHR. And it means ensuring that the pathway seamlessly integrates with the clinician's natural workflow, which will be the topic of our next lesson."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "In summary, Human Factors Engineering is a critical, and often overlooked, component of pathway design. By applying these principles, we can create pathways that are not only evidence-based, but also safe, effective, and user-friendly for the busy clinicians who use them every day.

"In our next lesson, we will delve deeper into the practical application of HFE, focusing on workflow analysis and re-engineering. Thank you."

## Lesson 2: Applying HFE to Clinical Pathways

**(Video Narration: 7-9 minutes)**

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we introduced the core principles of Human Factors Engineering. Today, we will discuss how to apply these principles to the design of clinical pathways through the processes of workflow analysis and re-engineering."

**(Transition Slide: Workflow Analysis)**

**Narrator:** "Before we can design a better system, we must first deeply understand the current system. This is the goal of workflow analysis. It involves systematically observing and documenting how care is actually delivered in a specific clinical environment. We are not just looking at the official policy; we are looking at the real-world practice, including the workarounds and shortcuts that people use to get their jobs done.

"Common methods for workflow analysis include:
*   **Direct Observation:** Shadowing clinicians to see how they interact with patients, colleagues, and the EHR.
*   **Interviews and Focus Groups:** Asking clinicians about their pain points and what works well.
*   **Process Mapping:** Creating a detailed flowchart of the current process to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

"From a health equity perspective, workflow analysis is also an opportunity to identify where systemic barriers or biases may be embedded in our current processes."

**(Transition Slide: Workflow Re-engineering)**

**Narrator:** "Once we have a clear understanding of the current state, we can begin the process of workflow re-engineering. This is not about making small tweaks; it is about fundamentally rethinking the process to make it safer, more efficient, and more patient-centered.

"In the context of a clinical pathway, this might involve:
*   **Simplifying the process:** Eliminating unnecessary steps or documentation.
*   **Integrating with the EHR:** The pathway should not feel like a separate task. It should be seamlessly integrated into the EHR workflow, with features like pre-populated order sets that align with the pathway's recommendations.
*   **Designing for usability:** The visual layout of the pathway in the EHR should be clean, clear, and intuitive. Using visual aids, like the 'wiremaps' we discussed in the IRB document, can make complex pathways much easier to follow.
*   **Considering the physical environment:** How does the physical layout of the emergency department or the clinic floor impact the workflow?"

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "The successful application of Human Factors Engineering is what separates a pathway that looks good on paper from one that actually works in practice. By starting with a deep understanding of the current workflow and then deliberately re-engineering it with the user in mind, we can create clinical pathways that reduce clinician burnout, improve patient safety, and advance health equity.

"This concludes our module on Human Factors Engineering. In our final module, we will discuss the critical last steps: Operational Execution and Impact. Thank you."
