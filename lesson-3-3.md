**Narrator:** "Welcome back. We've discussed the importance of making AI transparent and explainable. Now, let's explore how a thoughtfully designed AI can be used as a powerful tool to actively uncover and address the very human biases we discussed earlier in this module."

**Narrator:** "While AI can inherit bias from the data it's trained on, it can also be used to detect patterns of bias in our own practice. For example, an AI tool could analyze pathway adherence data across thousands of encounters and identify if clinicians are deviating from the pathway more often for patients of a certain race, gender, or socioeconomic status.

"This provides objective, system-level feedback that can help us recognize and address our own unconscious biases in a way that was never before possible. A transparent AI could then provide real-time, respectful alerts to clinicians, serving as a check against potential bias at the point of care."

**Narrator:** "It is critical to reiterate that AI is not a magic bullet. A poorly designed AI can easily amplify bias. That is why a relentless focus on health equity must guide every step of the development and implementation process. But when designed with intention, AI can be a powerful ally in building a more equitable healthcare system.

"This concludes our module. In our next module, we will discuss the principles of Human Factors Engineering. Thank you."
