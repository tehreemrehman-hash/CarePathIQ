## Lesson 2: The Core Domains of a Clinical Pathway

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we introduced the concept of a clinical pathway as a pillar for equitable, evidence-based care. Today, we're going to move from the 'what' to the 'how' by exploring the three core domains that form the backbone of nearly every clinical pathway: Diagnostics, Treatment, and Disposition."

**(Transition Slide: Diagnostics)**

**Narrator:** "Let's start with Diagnostics. This domain addresses the question: 'What is the most effective and efficient way to determine what is wrong with the patient?' Significant variation often exists here. One clinician might order a broad panel of tests, while another might take a more targeted approach. This can be driven by experience, habit, or bias, and it can lead to over-testing, missed diagnoses, and disparities in care.

"A clinical pathway standardizes the diagnostic process by providing clear guidance on:
*   **Risk Stratification:** Using validated tools and scores to objectively assess a patient's risk.
*   **Indications for Testing:** Clearly defining *when* a test is needed.
*   **Choice of Test:** Recommending the most appropriate and cost-effective test for the clinical scenario.

"By doing this, the pathway ensures a more consistent and equitable diagnostic journey for every patient."

**(Transition Slide: Treatment)**

**Narrator:** "Next, we have the Treatment domain. This addresses the question: 'What is the best, evidence-based therapy for this patient's condition?' Variation in treatment can be influenced by everything from a clinician's training to pharmaceutical marketing. This can lead to the use of less effective therapies, adverse drug events, and significant health disparities.

"Clinical pathways standardize treatment by:
*   **Recommending Evidence-Based Therapies:** Ensuring that the recommended treatments are backed by solid scientific evidence.
*   **Providing Dosing Guidance:** Reducing the risk of medication errors by specifying correct doses and frequencies.
*   **Defining Treatment Duration:** Preventing both under- and over-treatment.

"By embedding the best evidence directly into the workflow, the pathway makes it easier to do the right thing for every patient."

**(Transition Slide: Disposition)**

**Narrator:** "Finally, we have the Disposition domain. This is arguably one of the most complex domains, as it addresses the question: 'What is the safest and most appropriate next step for this patient?' This could be a discharge home, an admission to the hospital, or a transfer to another facility.

"We know that significant disparities exist in disposition. For example, there are documented racial disparities in patients leaving against medical advice, and socioeconomic factors can influence admission decisions.

"A well-designed pathway standardizes disposition by:
*   **Providing Clear Admission and Discharge Criteria:** Using objective criteria to guide these high-stakes decisions.
*   **Facilitating Safe Care Transitions:** Including checklists for medication reconciliation, patient education, and follow-up appointments.
*   **Integrating Social Determinants of Health:** Prompting the clinical team to consider factors like a patient's housing situation or access to transportation, and engaging interdisciplinary partners like social work to support a safe transition back to the community."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "In summary, the three core domains—Diagnostics, Treatment, and Disposition—provide the essential structure of a clinical pathway. By standardizing these key decision points, we can reduce unwarranted variation, mitigate bias, and move closer to our goal of providing equitable care for all.

"In our next module, we will explore how to find and appraise the high-quality evidence that is needed to build these domains. Thank you."
