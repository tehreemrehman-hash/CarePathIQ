## Lesson 2: The Core Domains: Diagnostics

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we introduced the concept of a clinical pathway. Today, we're going to begin exploring the three core domains that form its backbone, starting with Diagnostics."

**(Transition Slide: Diagnostics)**

**Narrator:** "The Diagnostics domain addresses the question: 'What is the most effective and efficient way to determine what is wrong with the patient?' Significant variation often exists here. One clinician might order a broad panel of tests, while another might take a more targeted approach. This can be driven by experience, habit, or bias, and it can lead to over-testing, missed diagnoses, and disparities in care.

"A clinical pathway standardizes the diagnostic process by providing clear guidance on:
*   **Risk Stratification:** Using validated tools and scores to objectively assess a patient's risk.
*   **Indications for Testing:** Clearly defining *when* a test is needed.
*   **Choice of Test:** Recommending the most appropriate and cost-effective test for the clinical scenario.

"By doing this, the pathway ensures a more consistent and equitable diagnostic journey for every patient. In our next lesson, we will explore the second core domain: Treatment. Thank you."
