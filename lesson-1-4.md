## Lesson 4: The Core Domains: Disposition

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. We've covered Diagnostics and Treatment. We now arrive at the final, and arguably one of the most complex, domains of a clinical pathway: Disposition."

**(Transition Slide: Disposition)**

**Narrator:** "The Disposition domain addresses the question: 'What is the safest and most appropriate next step for this patient?' This could be a discharge home, an admission to the hospital, or a transfer to another facility.

"We know that significant disparities exist in disposition decisions. A well-designed pathway standardizes this by:
*   **Providing Clear Admission and Discharge Criteria:** Using objective criteria to guide these high-stakes decisions.
*   **Facilitating Safe Care Transitions:** Including checklists for medication reconciliation, patient education, and follow-up appointments.
*   **Integrating Social Determinants of Health:** Prompting the clinical team to consider factors like a patient's housing situation or access to transportation to support a safe transition.

"By standardizing all three domains—Diagnostics, Treatment, and Disposition—we can reduce unwarranted variation and move closer to providing equitable care for all. In our next module, we will explore how to find the evidence needed to build these domains. Thank you."
