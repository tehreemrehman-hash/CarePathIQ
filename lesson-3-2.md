## Lesson 2: Explainable AI (XAI) for Trustworthy Systems

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we discussed how pathways can mitigate human cognitive biases. But for AI to be a trusted partner in this process, it cannot be a 'black box.' This is where the field of Explainable AI, or XAI, becomes critical."

**(Transition Slide: Explainable AI)**

**Narrator:** "The goal of XAI is to create AI systems that can explain *why* they have arrived at a particular recommendation. This is essential for building trust, identifying errors, and ensuring accountability.

"In a clinical pathway, a transparent AI wouldn't just alert a clinician to a patient at high risk for sepsis; it would also show the specific data points that led to that conclusionâ€”a rising lactate level, a subtle change in heart rate variability, or a phrase from a nursing note. This allows the clinician to use their own judgment to validate the AI's suggestion."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "This transparency is the foundation of a safe and effective human-AI collaboration. It allows us to leverage the analytical power of the machine without sacrificing the critical judgment of the human expert.

"In our next lesson, we will explore how AI can be used not just as a transparent tool, but as a proactive tool to uncover and address bias. Thank you."
