## Lesson 2: Workflow Analysis: Understanding the Current State

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we introduced the core principles of Human Factors Engineering. Today, we will discuss the first practical step in applying them: workflow analysis."

**(Transition Slide: Workflow Analysis)**

**Narrator:** "Before we can design a better system, we must first deeply understand the current one. Workflow analysis involves systematically observing and documenting how care is *actually* delivered in a clinical environment, including the workarounds and shortcuts people use to get their jobs done.

"Common methods for this include direct observation, interviews with clinicians, and creating detailed process maps. From a health equity perspective, this analysis is also a critical opportunity to identify where systemic barriers or biases may be embedded in our current processes."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "Only by first gaining a clear and honest understanding of the current state can we begin to design a future state that is safer, more efficient, and more equitable.

"In our next lesson, we will discuss that next step: workflow re-engineering. Thank you."
