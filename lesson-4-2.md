## Lesson 2: Applying HFE to Clinical Pathways

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we introduced the core principles of Human Factors Engineering. Today, we will discuss how to apply these principles to the design of clinical pathways through the processes of workflow analysis and re-engineering."

**(Transition Slide: Workflow Analysis)**

**Narrator:** "Before we can design a better system, we must first deeply understand the current system. This is the goal of workflow analysis. It involves systematically observing and documenting how care is actually delivered in a specific clinical environment. We are not just looking at the official policy; we are looking at the real-world practice, including the workarounds and shortcuts that people use to get their jobs done.

"Common methods for workflow analysis include:
*   **Direct Observation:** Shadowing clinicians to see how they interact with patients, colleagues, and the EHR.
*   **Interviews and Focus Groups:** Asking clinicians about their pain points and what works well.
*   **Process Mapping:** Creating a detailed flowchart of the current process to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

"From a health equity perspective, workflow analysis is also an opportunity to identify where systemic barriers or biases may be embedded in our current processes."

**(Transition Slide: Workflow Re-engineering)**

**Narrator:** "Once we have a clear understanding of the current state, we can begin the process of workflow re-engineering. This is not about making small tweaks; it is about fundamentally rethinking the process to make it safer, more efficient, and more patient-centered.

"In the context of a clinical pathway, this might involve:
*   **Simplifying the process:** Eliminating unnecessary steps or documentation.
*   **Integrating with the EHR:** The pathway should not feel like a separate task. It should be seamlessly integrated into the EHR workflow, with features like pre-populated order sets that align with the pathway's recommendations.
*   **Designing for usability:** The visual layout of the pathway in the EHR should be clean, clear, and intuitive. Using visual aids, like the 'wiremaps' we discussed in the IRB document, can make complex pathways much easier to follow.
*   **Considering the physical environment:** How does the physical layout of the emergency department or the clinic floor impact the workflow?"

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "The successful application of Human Factors Engineering is what separates a pathway that looks good on paper from one that actually works in practice. By starting with a deep understanding of the current workflow and then deliberately re-engineering it with the user in mind, we can create clinical pathways that reduce clinician burnout, improve patient safety, and advance health equity.

"This concludes our module on Human Factors Engineering. In our final module, we will discuss the critical last steps: Operational Execution and Impact. Thank you."
