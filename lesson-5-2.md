## Lesson 2: Evaluating Impact with the RE-AIM Framework

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome to our final lesson. A successful implementation is a major achievement, but our work is not done. We must also rigorously evaluate the impact of our clinical pathway to ensure that it is achieving its goals and to identify any unintended consequences.

"To do this, we will use a comprehensive evaluation model called the RE-AIM framework."

**(Transition Slide: RE-AIM graphic)**

**Narrator:** "RE-AIM is a framework for evaluating the public health impact of our interventions. It encourages us to look beyond traditional clinical outcomes and consider five crucial dimensions:

*   **Reach:** Who is the intervention actually reaching? Are all eligible patients being placed on our VTE pathway, or are certain populations being missed? We must analyze this with a health equity lens.
*   **Effectiveness:** Is the pathway improving patient outcomes and reducing disparities? Are we seeing a reduction in complications or length of stay? And are these improvements seen across all patient populations?
*   **Adoption:** Are individual clinicians and departments consistently using the pathway? What is the adoption rate, and what are the barriers for those who are not using it?
*   **Implementation:** Is the pathway being delivered as designed? Are clinicians adhering to the key components of the pathway? This is where we can monitor fidelity to our evidence-based recommendations.
*   **And finally, Maintenance:** Are the effects of the pathway sustained over time? Is it still being used six months or a year after the initial implementation? This is critical for long-term success."

**(Transition Slide: Health Equity Dashboard concept)**

**Narrator:** "A key part of monitoring the impact on health equity is the creation of a Health Equity Dashboard. This is a tool that tracks our process and outcome measures and stratifies them by race, ethnicity, language, and other demographic factors.

"This allows us to proactively identify disparities in near real-time. For example, we can monitor for disparities in deviations from the clinical pathway and investigate how those deviations might be impacting patient outcomes. This actionable data is the cornerstone of a true learning health system."

**(Transition Slide: Course Summary)**

**Narrator:** "And that brings us to the end of our course. We began with the promise of clinical pathways as a tool for a more equitable learning health system. We learned how to build them on a foundation of high-quality evidence, how to design them with an understanding of decision science and human factors, and finally, how to implement and evaluate them in a rigorous, data-driven way.

"My hope is that you now feel empowered to identify areas of variation in your own clinical practice and to apply these quality improvement methodologies to build a more equitable future for all of our patients. Thank you for joining me on this journey."
