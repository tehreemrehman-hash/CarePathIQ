## Lesson 2: Evaluating Impact with the RE-AIM Framework

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. A successful implementation is a major achievement, but our work is not done. We must also rigorously evaluate the impact of our clinical pathway. To do this, we will use a comprehensive evaluation model called the RE-AIM framework."

**(Transition Slide: RE-AIM graphic)**

**Narrator:** "RE-AIM is a framework for evaluating public health impact. It encourages us to look beyond traditional clinical outcomes and consider five crucial dimensions:

*   **Reach:** Who is the intervention actually reaching?
*   **Effectiveness:** Is the pathway improving outcomes and reducing disparities?
*   **Adoption:** Are clinicians and departments consistently using the pathway?
*   **Implementation:** Is the pathway being delivered as designed?
*   **And Maintenance:** Are the effects sustained over time?"

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "By evaluating our work across all five of these dimensions, we gain a holistic understanding of our pathway's true impact on the health of our patients and our community.

"In our final lesson, we will discuss a specific tool for monitoring one of the most important of these dimensions: health equity. Thank you."
