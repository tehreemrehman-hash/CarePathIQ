## Lesson 2: AI-Powered Evidence Synthesis

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. A core pillar of any clinical pathway is that it is built on the best available evidence. Traditionally, conducting the necessary systematic literature review is a monumental task, taking months or even years. This is where specialized AI tools have become transformative."

**Narrator:** "While generalist tools like ChatGPT can provide a starting point for a literature search, specialized platforms are far more powerful for this task. A tool like OpenEvidence, for example, is designed specifically for medical literature. You can ask it complex clinical questions in natural language, such as 'For adult patients with low pre-test probability for VTE, what is the comparative effectiveness of using the PERC rule versus D-dimer testing?'"

**Narrator:** "The AI will then survey thousands of relevant publications, synthesize the findings, and generate a direct answer with citations. This doesn't replace the need for human critical appraisal, but it reduces the time spent on searching and screening literature from months to mere minutes, allowing your team to focus on validating the evidence and designing the pathway.

"In our next lesson, we'll see how AI can help us visualize and develop the pathway's core logic. Thank you."
