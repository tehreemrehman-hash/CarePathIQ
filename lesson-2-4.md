## Lesson 4: AI in Clinical Decision Support

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we saw how AI can accelerate the synthesis of medical evidence. Now, we'll discuss how to get that evidence to the clinician at the point of care. This is the role of Clinical Decision Support, or CDS, systems.

"This lesson will explore how AI is making CDS more powerful, personalized, and integrated within our EHR-embedded clinical pathways."

**(Transition Slide: Old vs. New CDS)**

**Narrator:** "Traditional CDS is often rule-based and rigid, which can lead to alert fatigue. AI-powered CDS, on the other hand, is dynamic. It can analyze complex patterns in real-time patient data, personalizing recommendations based on a patient's unique profile.

"For example, an AI-powered CDS integrated into a sepsis pathway could continuously update a patient's risk score, recommend specific antibiotics based on local resistance patterns, and even use predictive analytics to help with resource planning. Crucially, it can leverage unstructured data, like a clinician's note, that a rule-based system would miss."

**(Transition Slide)**

**Narrator:** "While the promise is immense, we must proceed with a measured perspective. We must train clinicians to use these tools as a 'co-pilot,' not an autopilot, and the AI must be transparent, explaining *why* it's making a recommendation.

"AI is transforming clinical decision support into a dynamic, learning partner. When thoughtfully integrated, it can help us deliver the right care, to the right patient, at the right time.

"This concludes our module on Rapid Evidence Appraisal. In our next module, we will explore the intersection of Decision Science and Transparent AI. Thank you."
