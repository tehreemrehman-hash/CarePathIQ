**Narrator:** "Welcome to our final lesson. A well-designed pathway is only effective if it's successfully implemented, monitored, and continuously improved. AI can be a valuable partner in these final stages."

**Narrator:** "When it comes to implementation and dissemination, you can use generative AI to create tailored educational materials. For instance, you can ask Claude to 'Write a one-page summary of our new VTE pathway for emergency department nurses,' and then ask it to 'Rewrite this summary for an email to hospital leadership.' The AI can adapt the content and tone for different audiences, saving significant time."

**Narrator:** "Finally, for monitoring and evaluation, AI can help analyze free-text feedback from clinicians to identify common barriers to adoption. As we discussed in the RE-AIM framework, you need to track your impact. An AI can analyze free-text feedback from clinicians to identify common barriers to adoption. And as we've covered, a Health Equity Dashboard can use AI to proactively identify disparities in pathway use or outcomes, ensuring the pathway is truly advancing equitable care.

"This concludes our course. By thoughtfully integrating these powerful AI tools into each step of the lifecycle, you can design and operationalize clinical pathways that are more evidence-based, efficient, and equitable. Thank you."
