**Narrator:** "The Treatment domain addresses the question: 'What is the best, evidence-based therapy for this patient's condition?' Variation in treatment can be influenced by everything from a clinician's training to pharmaceutical marketing. This can lead to the use of less effective therapies, adverse drug events, and significant health disparities.

"Clinical pathways standardize treatment by:
*   **Recommending Evidence-Based Therapies:** Ensuring that the recommended treatments are backed by solid scientific evidence.
*   **Providing Dosing Guidance:** Reducing the risk of medication errors by specifying correct doses and frequencies.
*   **Defining Treatment Duration:** Preventing both under- and over-treatment.

"By embedding the best evidence directly into the workflow, the pathway makes it easier for clinicians to do the right thing for every patient. In our next lesson, we will cover the final core domain: Disposition. Thank you."
