## Lesson 1: Pathway Implementation with the DMAIC Model

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome to our final module. We have journeyed through the foundational pillars of clinical pathways, the evidence that supports them, the decision science that guides them, and the human factors engineering that makes them usable. Now, we arrive at the most critical stage: 'Operational Execution & Impact.'

"In this lesson, we will introduce a structured methodology from the world of quality improvement that is perfectly suited for implementing clinical pathways: the DMAIC model."

**Narrator:** "DMAIC is an acronym that stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. It's a data-driven improvement cycle used for improving, optimizing, and stabilizing business processes. Let's walk through how we can apply it to the implementation of a clinical pathway, using the example of a pathway for venous thromboembolism, or VTE.

*   **Define:** The first step is to clearly define the problem and the goals. What is the problem the VTE pathway would address? Perhaps it's significant variation in the use of diagnostic imaging. Who are the key stakeholders? This includes emergency physicians, hospitalists, radiologists, pharmacists, and of course, our patients. What is the scope of the project?

*   **Measure:** Next, we measure the current process and establish a baseline. How do we measure the problem? We would collect data on the current variation in diagnostics, treatment, and disposition for patients with suspected VTE. We would also specifically measure disparities by race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

*   **Analyze:** In this phase, we analyze the data to identify the root causes of the variation and disparities. Why are different clinicians ordering different tests? We can use tools like a fishbone diagram or the '5 Whys' to get to the root cause.

*   **Improve:** This is where we design and implement the clinical pathway. Based on our analysis, we would build our evidence-based decision trees for the pathway. We would then plan the implementation, considering the timeline, the setting, and the platform for dissemination, as we discussed in our module on Human Factors.

*   **Control:** Finally, we control the new process to ensure our improvements are sustained. Is the clinical pathway being reliably followed? We can use tools like run charts to track adherence over time. Has the pathway solved the problem? We can use regression analysis to see if variation has decreased."

**Narrator:** "The DMAIC model provides a rigorous, step-by-step framework for taking a clinical pathway from an idea to a fully operationalized tool. It ensures that our implementation efforts are data-driven, systematic, and focused on solving the right problems.

"In our final lesson, we will discuss how to evaluate the long-term impact of our pathway, with a particular focus on health equity. Thank you."
