**Narrator:** "Welcome to our final, and most practical, module. We've journeyed through the theory of clinical pathways. Now, we will focus on operational execution, exploring how specific AI tools can accelerate each step of the pathway lifecycle. In this lesson, we cover the initial Scoping and Discovery phase."

**Narrator:** "The first step is always to assemble a multidisciplinary team. But how do you ensure all perspectives are included? A generative AI tool like Google's Gemini or Anthropic's Claude can act as a brainstorming partner. You can prompt it to identify all potential stakeholders for a VTE pathway, and it might suggest roles you hadn't considered, like patient advocates or data analysts, ensuring a more holistic and equitable foundation from the start."

**Narrator:** "Next, you need to define clear, measurable objectives. Instead of vague goals, you can use a tool like ChatGPT to transform your ideas into SMART goals. For example, you can provide the prompt: 'Our goal is to reduce unnecessary CT scans for VTE. Turn this into three distinct SMART goals.' The AI will then generate specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound objectives to guide your project."

**(Transition Slide: Step 3 - Mapping the Current State)**
(voice-volume: normal)

**Narrator:** "Before you can improve a process, you must understand it. This involves mapping the current workflow. You can feed existing process documents, interview transcripts, and observations into a large language model. By asking it to 'summarize the key steps and identify potential bottlenecks or areas of variation in this process,' the AI can provide a structured analysis, helping you pinpoint exactly where the pathway is needed most.

"In our next lesson, we will dive deep into how AI is revolutionizing the critical step of evidence synthesis. Thank you."
