**Narrator:** "Welcome back. After synthesizing the evidence, the next step is to develop the pathway's algorithmâ€”the core decision-making logic. This is often visualized as a flowchart, and AI tools can help us create these representations with remarkable efficiency."

**Narrator:** "Mermaid is a tool that allows you to create complex diagrams and flowcharts from simple text-based code. While you can write this code manually, you can also use a generative AI like ChatGPT or Claude to create it for you. You can provide a prompt describing the logic of your VTE pathway in plain English."

**Narrator:** "For example, you could write: 'Create a Mermaid flowchart. The starting point is a patient with suspected VTE. The first decision is if the PERC rule is negative. If yes, the path ends with VTE excluded. If no, the next step is to check the D-dimer.' The AI will then generate the precise Mermaid code, which you can use to instantly create a clean, shareable flowchart of your clinical pathway. This dramatically accelerates the design and iteration process.

"In our final lesson, we'll discuss how AI can support the crucial last steps of implementation and evaluation. Thank you."
