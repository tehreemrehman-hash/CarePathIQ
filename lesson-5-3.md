## Lesson 3: Building a Health Equity Dashboard

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Narrator:** "Welcome to our final lesson. Throughout this course, we have emphasized that the ultimate goal of a clinical pathway is to advance health equity. To ensure we are meeting that goal, we need tools to proactively monitor our impact. One of the most powerful is a Health Equity Dashboard."

**(Transition Slide: Health Equity Dashboard concept)**

**Narrator:** "A Health Equity Dashboard is a tool that tracks our key process and outcome measures and, crucially, stratifies them by race, ethnicity, language, and other demographic factors. This allows us to identify disparities in near real-time.

"For example, we can monitor if there are disparities in how often clinicians deviate from the pathway, and then investigate how those deviations might be impacting patient outcomes. This actionable, stratified data is the cornerstone of a true learning health system."

**(Transition Slide: Course Summary)**

**Narrator:** "And that brings us to the end of our course. We have journeyed from the promise of clinical pathways to the practical, data-driven tools needed to implement and evaluate them with a focus on equity.

"My hope is that you now feel empowered to apply these methodologies to build a more equitable future for all our patients. Thank you for joining me on this journey."
